# Machine-Learning

## This course offered by Standford online learning on Cousera and taught by Prof. Andrew Ng. 

### 1. What is Machine learning?
#### In first week of this course, we learnt the basics of Machine learning and where it can be applied. It also explained type of learning, model representation, hypothesis representation, cost functions, parameter learning and gradient descent for regression. 

#### Algorithms and datasets used
#### i. Classifying emails as spam or not spam
#### ii. Housing price prediction
#### iii. Classification of benign and malignant tumor cells


### 2. Linear regression with multiple variables
#### In this week, author covered linear regression with multiple input features and best prectices to implement linear regression.

#### Algorithms and datasets used
#### i. Gradient descent for multiple variables
#### ii. Feature scaling and learning rate alpha
#### iii. Normal equation and non invertibility
